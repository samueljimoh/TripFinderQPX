### Web Application implemented using Object Oriented Programming concepts

### The user interface was designed using the Bootstrap framework, font-awesome icons and free stock pictures

### The web app can be viewed on [Slypedia MS Azure](http://slypedia.azurewebsites.net/)

The application development covered some of the following
1. Custom javascript validation object (Scripts/validate.js)
      A custom object with fields and properties that can be used to validate names, emails, and phone numbers on webpages

2. Ajax calls using jQuery methods (Scripts/app.js)
      Current weather temperatures are displayed on the homepage using the "openweathermap" API
      Flight information can also be displayed on the "Flight Search" page with the aid of the google QPX Express API

4. Custom page switcher function (Scripts/app.js)
      A custom function in javascript was made to execute page specific code, to reduce run-time errors
